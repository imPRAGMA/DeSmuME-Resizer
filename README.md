# DeSmuMAR
DeSmuME Aspect Ratio is an automated aspect ratio based resizing method for DeSmuME for playing in specific Aspect Ratio's.

## Usage

Download the [Latest Release] and extract the files next to DeSmuME. If you don't already have DeSmuME, extract it where you
wish DeSmuME to be as DeSmuMAR has an option to download the latest development release for you, which it will save next to DeSmuMAR.exe.

DeSmuMAR.exe must be next to DeSmuME.exe for it to work. The intended way to use DeSmuMAR is as a wrapper of DeSmuME.exe, essentially use
DeSmuMAR.exe exactly as you would DeSmuME.exe, e.g. as a Shortcut in your Start menu, as a file type association for .NDS, etc.

DeSmuMAR will only ask you the configuration you wish to use once, after that you will need to manually edit the DeSmuMAR.ini settings
file to make changes, or delete it for it to ask you again.
